# Spring-Security-Demo
The Spring Security Demo demonstrates how to secure a Spring Boot application using basic authentication and authorization. It includes a custom login page and features such as password encryption and logout functionality. Users can access different routes based on their roles, with a simple in-memory user store for authentication.
